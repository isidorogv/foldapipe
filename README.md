# foldapipe
PVC tube version of [FoldarapDDE](https://github.com/isidorogv/foldarapDDE) repository. A 1515 aluminium version can be found [in this repository](https://github.com/isidorogv/minifolda).

This is a **Proof of Concept (PoC)**, so it means it could be unfinished for your needs. This printer is functional, as a proof of concept states, but it has no any kind of tuning or optimization, neither firmware to control the hardware. **Marlin 2.0.5** has been used as firmware to test the printer. You can download Marlin firmware from [here](https://marlinfw.org/).

Printed pieces (_.STL_) are supplied in order to assembly the printer. If you want to modify any of these pieces, _.STEP_ files are also supplied. Download and use all these files **to your own risk!.**

Thanks for your attention.
